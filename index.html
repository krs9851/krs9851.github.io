		 	<h3>Applied Accessibility: My RIT Class</h3>
		 	
		 	<!-- RIT Class -->
		 	
		 	<p>
				From idea inception to grading the final projects, I ran every part of RIT's Applied Accessibility course. Before the class began, I created 12 lecture slide decks, the syllabus, all exam questions, and final project requirements. These resources focused on applying accessibility principles to web development, game design, and project management.
		 	</p>
		 	
		 	<p>
		 		During the semester, I ran lectures twice a week to a class of approximately 20 students. When students could not attend a class, I provided the recorded lectures to ensure nobody fell behind. I also made sure that all slide sheets, outside resources, and recordings were as accessible as possible. This included working with the ASL interpreters in how to best support my Deaf students. 
		 	</p>
		 	
		 	<p>	
		 		Accessibility can be intimidating, especially for students with disabilities. My goal in this course was to make software accessibility easy to understand and apply for anyone and everyone. These same principles inform how I approach teaching about accessibility in the corporate setting.

			<h3>Wish Guardian</h3>
			
			<!-- Wish Guardian -->
			
		 	<p>
		 		In 2020, I founded a team of designers and developers to create Wish Guardian, a video game focused on blending farming and card combat mechanics.
		 	</p>

			<p>
				During my time leading the team, we won a spot on the RIT Magic Makers Program's team, where we were paired with Rockstar Games to learn their ideas on game mechanics and effective storytelling. Then, In 2023, we were invited to the main floor of Imagine RIT to present the innovative accessibility features we had built in to our game platform. 
		 	</p>
			
			<p>
				Beyond being the team lead, I was the sole programmer for Wish Guardian. I wrote all code in C#, using Unity as the game engine.

		 	<h3>Finishing Strong</h3>
		 			 	
		 	<p> 
		 		After RIT's Magic Makers program had ended, our next challenge was to transform Wish Guardian into a polished product. During this time, we invested heavily into innovating new game accessibility features. That investment paid off when we presented at Imagine RIT in 2023.</p><p>Wish Guardian is currently available to play for free on itch.io!

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	I am looking for work in quality engineering, software engineering, or technical writing. My favorite type of work combines all three of those disciplines to create a well-rounded accessibility approach. When it comes to ADA compliance, there is no part of the process I don't enjoy. This work can be contract or full time position, I am open to either option.
