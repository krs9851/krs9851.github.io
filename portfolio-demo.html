<h1>Wish Guardian (2020-2024)</h1>
<p>In 2020, I founded a team of designers and developers to create Wish Guardian, a video game focused on blending farming and card combat mechanics.</p>
	
<p>During my time leading the team, we won a spot on the RIT Magic Makers Program's team, where we were paired with Rockstar Games to learn their ideas on game mechanics and effective storytelling. Then, In 2023, we were invited to the main floor of Imagine RIT to present the innovative accessibility features we had built in to our game platform.</p>

<p>Beyond being the team lead, I was the sole programmer for Wish Guardian. I wrote all code in C#, using Unity as the game engine.</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

		 	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		 	
		 	<!-- Starting the team -->
		 	
		 	<p>
		 		Although I was an experienced programmer, Wish Guardian was my first (and still only) video game. I taught myself C# and Unity, and built out the gameplay loop, using simple shapes as stand ins for future art.</p><p>I needed to make sure the concept was sound before creating my team.

			<h3>Continuing Further</h3>
			
			<!-- Magic Makers Program -->
			
		 	<p>
		 		Once I had a proof of concept, I promoted my video game idea through local video game events, and used the publicity to eventually build up a strong team. We gained funding and technical support through employment in RIT's Magic Makers Program. Every month, we met with top Rockstar designers and developers through RIT, and Wish Guardian slowly and steadily improved.

		 	<h3>Finishing Strong</h3>
		 	
		 	<!-- Imagine RIT -->
		 	
		 	<p> 
		 		After RIT's Magic Makers program had ended, our next challenge was to transform Wish Guardian into a polished product. During this time, we invested heavily into innovating new game accessibility features. That investment paid off when we presented at Imagine RIT in 2023.</p><p>Wish Guardian is currently available to play for free on itch.io!

<p class="final-video">
	The Wish Guardian team created an open source project based on our independently-developed accessibility features. Adding an accessibility feature is as easy as downloading a pre-packaged piece of code and running through the set up process. We believe that accessibility is a human right, and shouldn't be gatekept behind a time and money investment. <a href="https://github.com/krs9851/video-game-accessibility">Here is a link to the github repository!</a> We presented at Imagine RIT to increase understanding of video game accessibility, and to promote the "give an accessibility feature, take an accessibility feature" mindset. If all developers work together for a more accessible world, it reduces the workload of each feature.
